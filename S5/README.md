Session 5 

Approach
--------
Re-look at the code that we worked on in Assignment 4 (the fixed version). 
Move the contents of the code to the following files:
model.py
utils.py
S5.ipynb
Make the whole code run again. 
Upload the code with the 3 files + README.md file (total 4 files) to GitHub. README.md (look at the spelling) must have details about this code and how to read your code (what file does what). Heavy negative scores for not formatting your markdown file into p, H1, H2, list, etc. 
Attempt Assignment 5.
